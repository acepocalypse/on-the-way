      "\n",
      "This itinerary prioritizes budget-friendly options and balances hiking with scenic drives.  Driving times are estimates and can vary. Adjust based on your preferences and pace.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Day 1: Denver to Grand Junction, CO (approx. 4-5 hours driving)**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Scenic Drive:** Take I-70 West.  The initial part offers stunning views of the Colorado Rockies.  Consider a short detour to **Red Rocks Amphitheatre** (entrance fee applies, but worth it if you have time) for photos and a glimpse of the iconic venue.\n",
      "* **Budget-Friendly Activity:** Pack a picnic lunch to enjoy amidst the scenery.  Grand Junction has several affordable grocery stores for supplies.\n",
      "* **Budget-Friendly Accommodation:** Look for motels or budget-friendly hotels in Grand Junction.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Day 2: Grand Junction to Moab, UT (approx. 3-4 hours driving)**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Hiking (Budget-Friendly):**  Explore **Colorado National Monument**.  Several trails offer stunning canyon views with varying difficulty levels. Many trails are free, but there's an entrance fee to the park itself.  Alternatively, check out some free trails near Grand Junction before heading to Moab.\n",
      "* **Scenic Drive:** The drive from Grand Junction to Moab is itself scenic, passing through red rock country.\n",
      "* **Budget-Friendly Accommodation:** Moab offers hostels, campgrounds (check availability and book in advance), and budget motels.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Day 3: Moab, UT (Full Day)**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Hiking (Budget-Friendly):** Moab is a hiker's paradise! **Delicate Arch Trail** in Arches National Park (entrance fee applies) is iconic but strenuous.  Consider easier options like **Landscape Arch Trail** (Arches) or trails in **Canyonlands National Park** (entrance fee applies; consider a park pass if you plan to visit multiple parks). Check the weather and trail conditions before heading out. Pack plenty of water!\n",
      "* **Budget-Friendly Activity:** Enjoy a sunset view over the red rock formations.  Itâ€™s free and spectacular!\n",
      "\n",
      "**Day 4: Moab to Las Vegas, NV (approx. 6-7 hours driving)**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Scenic Drive:**  This leg offers less dramatic scenery than previous days but still pleasant desert landscapes.  Consider a slight detour to **Valley of Fire State Park** in Nevada (entrance fee applies) for some short hikes amongst red sandstone formations.  It's a stunning introduction to the Nevada desert landscape.\n",
      "* **Budget-Friendly Activity:** Stop at roadside viewpoints for photos and stretches.  Pack snacks and drinks to avoid expensive gas station purchases.\n",
      "* **Budget-Friendly Accommodation:** Arrive in Las Vegas and check into a budget-friendly hotel or consider staying outside the Strip for cheaper options.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**Tips for Budget Travel:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Camping:** Consider camping one or two nights to save significantly on accommodation costs.  Book campsites in advance, especially during peak season.\n",
      "* **Pack your own food:** Eating out constantly can drain your budget. Pack lunches and snacks to save money.\n",
      "* **Look for free activities:** Many scenic viewpoints and hiking trails are free.  Take advantage of these opportunities.\n",
      "* **Travel during the off-season:**  Prices for accommodation and park entrance fees may be lower during the shoulder seasons (spring and fall).\n",
      "* **Utilize free Wi-Fi:**  Use free Wi-Fi at restaurants, libraries, or your accommodation to avoid data roaming charges.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember to check the weather forecast, pack appropriate clothing and gear for hiking (including plenty of water), and be aware of altitude sickness, especially if you're not used to higher elevations. Enjoy your road trip!\n",
